# TEST Angular + Browserify Boilerplate

This is very simple boileplate code for modular AngularJS application. Work is still in progress, 
so new features will be added and bugs will be fixed. You are free to fork this and I'm open to advices
 and suggestions.
 
## Key ideas

1. No Bower
2. No ng-controller
3. Stateless directives

(will later explain why)

## Software requirements

NodeJS 0.10+

## How to run
It's pretty simple:

1. Run ```npm install```
2. ```gulp build```
